#### A guide covering Assembly programming language including the x86 computer architectures, applications and tools that will make you a better and more efficient developer.

## Resources

[Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) is a low-level programming language. It uses mnemonic codes and labels to represent machine-level code with each instruction corresponding to just one machine operation.

[RISC-V Foundation](https://riscv.org/) is a non-profit corporation controlled by its 500 members(NVIDIA, Google, Samsung, Raspberry Pi, SiFive, Canonical, and Western Digital) to drive forward the adoption and implementation of the free and open RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA).

## Tools

[Arm Instruction Emulator (ArmIE)](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/server-and-hpc/compile/arm-instruction-emulator/resources/tutorials) is a tool that emulates Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) and SVE2 instructions on AArch64/ARM64 platforms. 

[FASM (flat assembler)](https://flatassembler.net/) is an assembler for x86 processors that supports Intel-based assembly language on the IA-32 and x86-64 computer architectures. 

[Microsoft Assembler (MASM) for x64](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/assembler/masm/masm-for-x64-ml64-exe) is Microsoft's assembler that accepts x64 assembler language. 

[MASM/TASM](https://github.com/xsro/masm-tasm) is a VSCode extension that offers a way to run and debug DOS(80x86) assembly TASM/MASM through DOSBox and msdos-player.

[NASM](https://nasm.us/) is an asssembler/disassembler for the x86 CPU architecture portable to nearly every modern platform, and with code generation for many platforms old and new.

[GAS](https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/) is the assembler used by the GNU Project for the default back-end of GCC. It is used to assemble the GNU operating system and the Linux kernel.

[MIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_Technologies) is a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) instruction set architecture (ISA) developed by [MIPS Technologies, Inc.](https://www.mips.com/). In June 2018 [MIPS was Acquired by AI Startup Wave Computing](https://www.top500.org/news/mips-acquired-by-ai-startup-wave-computing/).

[LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/) is a library that has collection of modular/reusable compiler and toolchain  components (assemblers, compilers, debuggers, etc.). With these components LLVM can be used as a compiler framework, providing a front-end(parser and lexer) and a back-end (code that converts LLVM's representation to actual machine code).

[TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/) is a Go compiler(based on LLVM) intended for use in small places such as microcontrollers, WebAssembly (Wasm), and command-line tools.

[Tock](https://www.tockos.org/) is an embedded operating system designed for running multiple concurrent, mutually distrustful applications on Cortex-M and RISC-V based embedded platforms. Tock's design centers around protection, both from potentially malicious applications and from device drivers. 

[PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) is a professional collaborative platform for embedded development with no vendor lock-in. It provides support for multiplatforms and frameworks such as IoT, Arduino, CMSIS, ESP-IDF, FreeRTOS, libOpenCM3, mbed OS, Pulp OS, SPL, STM32Cube, Zephyr RTOS, ARM, AVR, Espressif (ESP8266/ESP32), FPGA, MCS-51 (8051), MSP430, Nordic (nRF51/nRF52), NXP i.MX RT, PIC32, RISC-V.

[PlatformIO for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide) is a plugin that provides support for the PlatformIO IDE on VSCode.

[Keystone](https://github.com/keystone-engine/keystone) is a lightweight multi-platform, multi-architecture(Arm, Arm64, Hexagon, Mips, PowerPC, Sparc, SystemZ & X86) assembler framework.

[Unicorn](https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn) is a lightweight, multi-platform, multi-architecture CPU emulator framework(ARM, AArch64, M68K, Mips, Sparc, X86) based on [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/).
